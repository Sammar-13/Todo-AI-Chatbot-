# Phase 2: Core Backend API Development - Constitution

## Vision Statement
Build a robust, scalable backend API that serves as the foundation for the todo application, implementing core business logic for authentication, user management, and todo operations.

## Goals
1. Implement RESTful API with proper routing and middleware
2. Set up database schema and ORM/ODM integration
3. Implement authentication and authorization system
4. Implement user management functionality
5. Implement todo CRUD operations
6. Add comprehensive error handling and validation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Frontend development
- Advanced features (collaboration, sharing, etc.)
- Real-time functionality
- Analytics and reporting
- Email notifications (basic setup only)

## Success Criteria
- All REST API endpoints functional and tested
- Database properly designed and migrated
- Authentication system working correctly
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Error handling follows standards
- API documentation complete (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Unit test coverage >80%

## Constraints
- Must follow RESTful conventions
- Must implement proper authentication
- Must validate all inputs
- Must handle errors gracefully
- Must be scalable for future features
